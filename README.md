# Java_Music_Player
This is a program that is supposed to look in your file system for an MP3 file. Once the MP3 file is selected, the program
loads it into the media player and plays the MP3. Buttons for the MP3 player are provided in the repository.

NOTE: MP3 file paths will have to be provided in order for the player to work (See Program).
